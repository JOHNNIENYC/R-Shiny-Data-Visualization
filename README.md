## Intruduction

[This interactive Shiny App](https://johnnielinke.shinyapps.io/data/) is designed to help users to explore US salaries and gain meaningful insights by comparing among different occupations/states in different years (from 2016 to 2020). The app mainly contains 3 tabs for interactive analysis, which include United States, US State, and Occupation Type.

## 1)	United States

Select a year, hover over the map and put the mouse pointer in each state to display annual salary(average) in the state. In addition, 3 boxes above the map automatically show number of people employed, highest-pay occupation, and highest-pay US state for the year selected.

## 2) US State
This tab enables users to explore the trend of salary change for different occupations from 2016 to 2020. In addition, users can select an occupation which interests them and then explore further about the occupation by looking at its sub-categories.
