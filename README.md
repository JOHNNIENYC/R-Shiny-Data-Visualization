# R-Shiny-Data-Visualization

Introduction
This interactive Shiny App is designed to help users to explore US salaries and gain meaningful insights by comparing among different occupations/states in different years (from 2016 to 2020). The app mainly contains 3 tabs for interactive analysis, which include United States, US State, and Occupation Type.

1)	United States
Select a year, hover over the map and put the mouse pointer in each state to display annual salary(average) in the state. In addition, 3 boxes above the map automatically show number of people employed, highest-pay occupation, and highest-pay US state for the year selected.

  

2)	US State
This tab enables users to explore the trend of salary change for different occupations from 2016 to 2020. In addition, users can select an occupation which interests them and then explore further about the occupation by looking at its sub-categories.

  

3)	Occupation Type
Select an occupation type. In the trend tab, search one or multiple US states to explore the trend of salary change for the states selected. In the explore tab, select a year to view the top 10 states with the highest salary in the year selected.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108529441/183308105-0f855a89-2137-4164-9bed-05b576b0b5ad.png)
